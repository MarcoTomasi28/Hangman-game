# Hangman-game

This is a version of the hangman game written in python. The game is in the game folder, 
I recommend using the .txt file, but feel free to use and edit the .py file. As soon as 
the game is started, you can choose the difficulty and the language (the game is available in 
English and Italian). I am still working on including suggestions for each difficulty. 
Have fun!
